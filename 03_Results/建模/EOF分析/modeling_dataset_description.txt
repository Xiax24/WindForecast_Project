  - reconstructed_30m: EOF1-based 30m wind reconstruction  
  - reconstructed_50m: EOF1-based 50m wind reconstruction
  - reconstructed_70m: EOF1-based 70m wind reconstruction

RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY:
  10m:
    - Correlation with observed: 0.9274
    - RMSE: 1.9036 m/s
    - MAE: 1.4759 m/s
    - Bias: -0.0000 m/s
  30m:
    - Correlation with observed: 0.9838
    - RMSE: 1.7603 m/s
    - MAE: 1.3708 m/s
    - Bias: 0.0000 m/s
  50m:
    - Correlation with observed: 0.9882
    - RMSE: 2.0868 m/s
    - MAE: 1.6649 m/s
    - Bias: -0.0000 m/s
  70m:
    - Correlation with observed: 0.9797
    - RMSE: 2.2193 m/s
    - MAE: 1.7765 m/s
    - Bias: -0.0000 m/s

EOF COMPONENTS:
  - PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4: Principal component time series
  - eof1_target: Primary target (copy of PC1)

DATA SPLIT:
  - data_split: train/test available

RECONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGY:
  - Method: wind_reconstructed = mean_wind + EOF1_timeseries Ã— EOF1_spatial_coefficient
  - EOF1 explains: 94.1% of wind profile variance
  - All heights reconstructed using same EOF1 time series

NEXT STEPS:
1. Load this dataset
2. Train model: corrected_10m â†’ eof1_target
3. Predict EOF1 for new data
4. Reconstruct 70m: predicted_EOF1 Ã— EOF1_70m_coeff + mean_70m
5. Compare with reconstructed_70m column for validation

VALIDATION OPPORTUNITY:
- Use reconstructed_70m vs obs_wind_speed_70m to validate EOF approach
- High correlation indicates EOF method is viable for this dataset
